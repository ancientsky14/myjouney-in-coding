        <p class="text">In a stunning turn of events, 87-year-old Edna Martinez single-handedly prevented an extraterrestrial catastrophe by sharing her WiFi password with confused aliens. "They just needed good internet to contact their mothership," Edna explained with a smile. The aliens, grateful for the gesture, decided to cancel their invasion plans and instead opened a small bakery in downtown Portland.</p>
        <p class="text">In a surprising twist, the bakery became a local favorite, serving pastries inspired by intergalactic flavors. Edna often visits, sharing stories of her alien friends and their unique recipes.</p>
